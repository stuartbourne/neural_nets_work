# Overview
This repository houses basic neural networks written in both python and C++.
This primarily serves as a learning experience for building networks from scratch,
with the objective of leading to building up a convolutional neural network to 
classify digits.

First, the networks are written in python due to the ability to easily plot values using
pyplot, then they are converted to C++ to allow for optimal computation times.
